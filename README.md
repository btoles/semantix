# Usage
Semantix keeps track of your projects version number and generates release notes/changelogs automatically.  All that needs to be done to leverage Semantix is to format your commits in a specific way.
## Commit Format
`keyword`: A predefined string indicating how much to bump the project version.

`scope`: An ***optional*** argument specifying the scope of the commit -- used in the release process to annotate release tags and generate changelogs.

Mapping specific `keyword` to release types (major, minor, patch) can be customized and defined in a `.semantix.yml` configuration file.

```
keyword: 🍔🥓🍟
keyword(scope): This is my commit message!
```

> 🚨 **NOTE**: Be careful when merging pull requests and using the *squash* feature.  Commit messages need to maintain their specific format in order to be picked up by the *semantix* commit parser.

## package.json
*Example*
```json
"scripts": {
    "latest": "semantix latest",
    "next": "semantix next",
    "update": "semantix update",
    "release": "semantix release"
}
```
## Command Line
```
npx semantix <command> [option]
```

# Order of Precedence
If no additional options are given to *semantix* then the default values will be used. Otherwise, values will be read from the the command line `--options` first and the missing variables filled in with the `.semantix.yml` configuration file.  

It is recommended to use `.semantix.yml` for all your configuration and only use the command line `--options` as overrides.


# Configuration
> You may store your configuration and override some defaults in a `.semantix.yml` file
## *`.semantix.yml`*
```yml
branch: master
release:
    BREAKING: major
    feat: minor
    perf: minor
    refactor: minor
    ci: patch
    init: patch
    chore: patch
    fix: patch
    test: patch
    docs: patch
```
